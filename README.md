## Project Overview
This project visualizes the IPL statistics of Indian players who are nominated for the T20 World Cup 2024. The dashboard is created using Tableau and provides dynamic insights into player performance through various KPIs and charts.

The dashboard includes:
- Dynamic player images that change based on the selected player.
- KPIs for batting and bowling statistics.
- Visualizations for the number of 4s, 6s, not outs (NO), matches played, and more.
- Line charts comparing various metrics like runs made, strike rate, wickets taken, and economy rate.
